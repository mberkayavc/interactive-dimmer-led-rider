# interactive-dimmer-led-rider
 Interactive LED Pattern Changer is a project that runs on STM32F107VG Discovery Board. This project features three LEDs that are controlled via a simple button with dimmer function and flash in a specific pattern.

## Features

- Switching between three different LED patterns when the button is pressed.
- Represents a specific visual pattern for each LED pattern.
- LED control using GPIO pins on the STM32F10x microcontroller.
